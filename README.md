**Data Pre-Processing Checkpoint**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data preprocessing techniques using Python and common data science libraries. 
The purpose of this notebook is to guide users through essential data cleaning and preprocessing steps necessary to prepare a dataset for analysis or machine learning.

**Files**
Data_pre-processing_checkpoint.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code and explanations for various data preprocessing techniques, 
including handling missing values, encoding categorical data, standardizing or normalizing numerical values, and more.

**Requirements**
To run this notebook, you need the following libraries installed:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

**How to Open the Notebook**
**Option 1: Using Jupyter Notebook**
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
In the Jupyter interface, locate and open Data_pre-processing_checkpoint.ipynb.

**Code Overview**
**Sections of the Notebook**
The notebook is divided into several sections to guide you through different steps of data preprocessing:

Importing Libraries: The notebook begins by importing essential libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

Loading the Dataset: The code demonstrates how to load a dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. It may use a sample CSV file or data sourced from an online dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Viewing the Data: The notebook includes commands to display the first few rows of the dataset, inspect column data types, and get a summary of the data.
Summary Statistics: It shows summary statistics for numerical columns to understand data distribution.
Handling Missing Values:

Identifying Missing Data: Code is provided to identify missing values in the dataset.
Imputing Missing Values: Various methods are shown for filling in missing values, including replacing with the mean, median, mode, or simply dropping rows/columns with missing data.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Label Encoding: Demonstrates how to convert categorical data into numerical data using LabelEncoder from Scikit-learn.
One-Hot Encoding: Shows how to perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables with multiple categories.
Feature Scaling:

Normalization: Code for normalizing numerical features to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1).
Standardization: Demonstrates standardizing numerical features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
Saving the Preprocessed Data:

Shows how to save the cleaned and transformed dataset to a new CSV file.
